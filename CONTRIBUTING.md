## New layouts

You can add your layout following the structure of the project and making a [pull request](https://github.com/bibizio/cv/pulls):

1. fork the project.
2. chose a name for you layout and create an .html in the **_/\_layouts_** folder.
3. create a directory in **_/assets/styles_** named after your layput with all the css'.
4. write an example of your template (your true cv or a fictional one) in a markdown file named after you layout in the **_en/examples_** folder (if you know Italian or want to have fun, add one in **_/it/examples_** also)
5. add a link to your layout example in the [readme](README.md)
6. in case you need to write instructions for your layout, do so under the layout link.
